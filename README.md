# iOS - TestBench
A testbench for my iOS projects - it's rather a collection of the apps I've built.

## Contents
* Basic Calculator
    * UIButton, UILabel and MVC
    * Showing master view controller instead of detail
* Graphic Calculator (under construction)
* Core Motion Demo
    * Gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer, and compass
* ImageShower
    * shows an image by entering the URL in the text field
    * UIActivityIndicator, UIScrollView, and multithreading
* Haptic Feedback Simulator
    * UISelectionFeedbackGenerator, UIImpactFeedbackGenerator, UINotificationFeedbackGenerator
* Natural Language Processor
    * Uses NSLinguisticTagger to determine if a noun is singular
* BDKCollectionIndexView -> Testing
    * Looks fine on iPhones, but will clutter on iPads
